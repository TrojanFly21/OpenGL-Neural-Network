# OpenGL-Neural-Network
Neural Network using OpenGL

Aim:Aim is to project an 3D view of moving image or a
motion of a building blocks which shows how neural network
looks, In this project we try to visualize this very basic framework using
OpenGL. OpenGL is a computer graphics library on which many
rendering and visualization softwares are built.

Overview :
Neural Network is one of the basic building blocks of Deep
Learning. It is the fundamental algorithm that forms the basis of complex
and advanced Deep Learning. Deep Leanring and Artificial Intelligence
has shaped the modern technology and is certainly going to revolutionize
the future.
